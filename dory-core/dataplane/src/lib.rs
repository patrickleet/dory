//! `dory-dataplane` — the host-side docker proxy embedded in the VMM helper (`dory-vmm` for VZ,
//! `dory-hv` for the docker tier) via FFI. It serves `dory.sock`, classifies each request, applies
//! the shared-VM create rewrites, and splices the connection to the guest `dockerd` over the vsock
//! bridge — bytes never cross into Swift. `payload never touches doryd`.
//!
//! This crate holds the pure, unit-tested logic (head parse, classify, create rewrite). The socket
//! accept loop + vsock dial + the [`dory_proto::half_close`] splice are wired by the embedding VMM
//! process (which owns the captive vsock fds); [`proxy_disposition`] is the single entry the serving
//! loop calls per connection once the head has arrived.
